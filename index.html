        <h3>Little bit about myself...</h3>
    <h4>I was born in Daegu, South Korea. My first language is Korean and my second language is English. I am currently a Senior in Florida State University pursuing Information Technology. I consider myself as a software developer and have familiarized myself with some different programming languages. Java, SQL, HTML & CSS are languages that I am passionate about and continuing to further my knowledge to be proficient in them. My teamwork and leadership skills have helped me to be successful in what I do in various settings. My willingness to learn has helped me to adapt to new languages quickly.</h4>

    <h2><strong>Library Technology Intern</strong></h2>
    <h4><em>FSU College of Communication & Information Goldstein Library - January 2016 - May 2016</em></h4>
  My job as an intern for the library was to organize and publish both written and visual documents of 3D
printer usability. Throughout the semester, I engaged in thorough experiments on how one can
efficiently use Dremel 3D Idea Builder and recorded the progress I made. I communicated with my
professor efficiently to update him about my progress and ask any questions that needed to be
answered. One of the few challenges I faced while working was that the 3D printer was something new
for me. It was my first time handling a 3D printer and I had a lot of questions about it. I had to research
intensively from the outside source to learn how to operate this machine correctly. The technical skills I
have developed while working was to be able to learn full capabilities of Dremel 3D Idea Builder.

  <h2 id="expl"><strong>Cultural Tutor</strong></h2>
  <h4><em>KK Talkee - September 2015 - Present</em></h4>
    This job allowed me to communicate with people from the other side of the world. I hosted 3 hour long
online session each weak to Chinese audiences and helped to reinforce their English. My passion is to
talk about diversity and culture so I was able to use my passion to talk to them about American and
Korean culture. This helped them to gain more insight about America and they were able to learn
English as we naturally engaged in such conversations. Some of the skillsets I have acquired and
strengthened are communication and adaptability.

    <h2 id="expl"><strong>Sales System Technical Assistant</strong></h2>
    <h4><em>Eli's Collection - June 2014 - August 2014</em></h4>
    I supervised sales associates during all sales transactions. Along with the supervision of sales
associates, my additional role was to create barcodes for all new products in the store. Throughout
the few months of working, I engaged in constant communication with the manager and sales
associates to operate the store in smooth condition. My technical knowledge has helped the store to
improve POS system for increased efficiency when transacting sales. One if the few challenges I
faced while working was understanding full functionalities of the store. I had to quickly adapt to the
culture and setting of the workplace and analyze how my skills can contribute to benefit the store.
